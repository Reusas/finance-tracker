# Finance-tracker

This project is a web tracking application built using react and next.js. This is my first ever attempt at making a web application using react. This project is unfinished and is more
of a template for a finance tracker application. The main and basic functionality is implemented but there is a ton of improvements to be made and extra features to be added.

# Features


* Hosted on vercel. Accesible at: https://finance-tracker-seven-inky.vercel.app/

* Has account functionality. Users can sign up and login to an account using an email and password.

* Is connected to a Postgres database on vercel. User data is stored here and passwords are stored securely using bcrypt.

* Dashboard page allows users to create finance entries that are stored in the database and shown on the app via pie charts that was implemented with chart.js.

* Users can change the password of their account or remove their account entirely in the settings page.

# Missing features

* More styling and a nicer looking layout

* APIs arent secured

* Forgot password/password reset feature and third party logins (via Google and such)

* Setting financial goals/deadlines and getting reports.
